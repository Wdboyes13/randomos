Tiny, simple, and portable static [Linker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing))
for the [ELF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) format.


## 🛠 Features
- Command-line interface for direct usage  
- No OS-specific dependency (portable across platforms)  
- Supports section alignment, entry point overrides, and more  
- Usable as a library or standalone binary  


## 🚀 Usage

```
ezld by Alessandro Salerno
The EZ ELF Linker

Usage: ezld [<command>] [<options>] [<input files>]

COMMANDS:
    -h, --help         Show this menu
    -v, --version      Show version information

OPTIONS:
    -e, --entry-sym    Set the entry point symbol (default: '_start')
    -s, --section      Set base virtual address for section (e.g., -s .text=0x4000)
    -a, --align        Set PT_LOAD segment alignment (e.g., -a 0x1000)
    -o, --output       Set output file path (default: 'a.out')
```

## ⚙️ Building from Source

Use the included `Makefile` to build:

```bash
make debug    # Build with debug info, sanitizers, -O0
make release  # Build optimized release version
make library  # Build as a static library
```

## 📦 Installing via tarman

Install with [`tarman`](https://github.com/Alessandro-Salerno/tarman) from the [tarman user repository](https://github.com/Alessandro-Salerno/tarman-user-repository):

```bash
tarman install -r ezld
```

## 🌍 Portability

Though it links ELF binaries, it's designed to run on any host, including:
- 🪟 Windows
- 🐧 Linux
- 🍎 macOS
- 🌈 [SalernOS](https://github.com/Alessandro-Salerno/SalernOS-Kernel)

ezld avoids non-standard libc functions, improving portability and making it
suitable for low-level projects, OS userspace testing, or educational purposes.

## 💻 Project Context

ezld was created as part of the [`ARES`](https://github.com/ldlaur/ares) project.
It’s meant to be a **learning tool** and **experimentation ground** for understanding
the inner workings of static linking and ELF formats.
